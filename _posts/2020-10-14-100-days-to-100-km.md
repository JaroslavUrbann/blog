I started running due to my general lack of movement following the breakout of the pandemic.
Since I didn’t want to waste my soon to be found running skills, I also decided to run the Prague marathon to top off my efforts.
When (~26.5.2020) I got this brilliant idea, I was in luck since the Prague marathon was postponed from 3.5. to 11.10. which was kinda perfect for my purposes. I immediately registered as I didn’t want to lose a chance that was so gracefully handed to me.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The pandemic giveth and the pandemic taketh away - a month later, I got an email that the Prague marathon has been canceled entirely, due to the ongoing uncertainty and monetary issues.<br/>
“Well, that’s an opportunity to visit Berlin again and run the Berlin marathon underneath the Brandenburg gate instead!”, I said.<br/>
“No”, said the pandemic, and the marathon got canceled.<br/>
“Let’s go to Vien-“, “No”, the pandemic reiterated.<br/>
But Warsaw’s got my back, look at this confident and motivational statement they put out that day:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
>"...The Warsaw Marathon has been held continuously for 41 years and it has permanently entered the sport calendars of this country and its capital. It wasn’t stopped by martial law, by the lack of interest in running in the 90s or by the sudden surrender of the former organisers of this event. This year’s edition is facing a difficult test which is why we are determined to continue the history of Warsaw Marathon as a symbol of its perseverance."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Nope, registration got closed off early and the race was supposed to be run on a 5 km lap with a raffle determining who was going to gain entry. I say “supposed to” because I never bothered to check if it happened as they said and left to search for something better.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I haven’t run a single marathon and I was already fed up with them. I knew I had to find something more niche so the pandemic would overlook it. Furthermore I kinda already knew I could finish a marathon (consistent weekly runs were doing their job) so I wasn’t very much excited about running one just for the sake of saying I ran a marathon. *I mean, what’s the point of running a marathon if you know you’re able to run a marathon?*<br/>
Especially if you don’t care about your finish time.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So I signed up for a 100k.<br/>
This was around two weeks prior to the starting date (5.9.2020 - exactly 102 days after I started running).

The face of true pain 50 km in - the sun just rose and you can see a field full of fog behind me that I ran through a few minutes ago.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
That’s it. No finish photo. I was quite dead and I walked for the last 10 km as my leg got injured.
I successfully finished the race and now I'm at home, counting my useless pandemic ITRA points. Next up is the Prague marathon in 2021, seeing as they don't do refunds ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
