## A book by Immanuel Kant
In this book, Kant sets out a task of determining that moral obligation is something that we can derive just by pure reason; without the need for any empirical evidence.  He seeks to show that a person ought to act morally, as long as they are rational and that ethical obligation is something outside just the subjective experience, Just like the fact that 2 + 2 = 4 can be derived rationally and not just by inductive generalization of experience, he is determined to ground morality in logic and derive it analytically.

Kant divides judgments into 3 separate groups. Analytical judgments, which are the judgments where the predicament is contained in the subject itself, therefore they don't explicitly add anything new. Synthetic _a priori_ judgments - this is when we can derive something new about a subject just by pure reason, independent of experience. And finally, a synthetic _a posteriori_ judgments, which are things known from experience.

He then shows that our maxims determine the moral worth of our actions. Whereby maxims he means the inclinations or goals you're trying to maximize by choosing such action. He says that the only thing that is good without qualification is a good will and that after stripping away the chain of reasoning as to why we respect moral values, we come to something he calls the categorical imperative, a law that has no further conditions and must be respected for its' own sake. He then defines this imperative through three different formulations: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1) You ought never to act except in such a way that you could also will that your maxim should become a universal law.

2) Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of another, always as an end, and never simply as a means.

3) Act as though through your maxims you could become a legislator of universal laws.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Kant is saying is, that if we aren't able to wish that the maxim we act upon could be made into a universal principle, then our action has no moral worth. The example Kant gives goes like this: Imagine you were in a desperate situation and in the need of borrowing money without being able to repay someone who might lend you said money. If you choose to lie and say that you will repay them then your maxim isn't in coherence with the categorical imperative, since you cannot possibly wish that when anyone is in the desperate need of money they ought to lie, because in that universe no one would believe you in such a situation and you would get laughed at for this meaningless attempt. Thus in creating this kind of a natural contradiction, your maxim could not become a universal law and is therefore not morally sound. 

Another one of his thoughts is that since the value of things doesn't rest in themselves, but rather in what we do with those things and what they mean to us. Therefore, when we decide to pursue those things, we take ourselves as important and we treat ourselves as our own ends. And since people are ends in themselves, if you use another person just as a means to pursue your own end, without respecting them and not inviting them to cooperation, you are violating the moral law. This is tightly connected with the second formulation of the categorical imperative above and to the concept of _kingdom of ends_ - a world where all beings treat each other as ends in themselves.

Freedom of a person's will is also very important to Kant. He doesn't ask whether we have free will, but he asks whether we have the grounds to regard ourselves as free. He concludes that we need to think of ourselves as in two different worlds. We are free in the world of understanding and our actions are determined in the world of sense and these two worlds must coexist together.
