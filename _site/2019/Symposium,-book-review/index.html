<h1 id="symposium-bookreview">Symposium, book👏review👏</h1>

<p>I read the whole book and I liked it, but I felt like I needed something more logic-based after I finished reading it.</p>

<h2 id="random-note">Random note</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I was surprised how bisexual everyone was. When some of them talked about the concept of love, they were talking about the homosexual relationship between an older and a younger man.</li>
  <li>One person even said that love of boys is a more noble kind of love because they are born smarter and overall better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-actual-point-of-the-book">Notes on the actual point of the book:</h2>

<p>Every speaker took a turn and shared their take on Eros with others, here are some points they made that I still remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is an upper and a lower kind of love
    <ul>
      <li>lower love is the love of things that change: money, appearance, etc.</li>
      <li>upper love is the love of the truth, which doesn’t change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When people do things for love, even the most atypical kind of behavior suddenly becomes acceptable</li>
  <li>
    <p>One speaker had a theory that people originally had 2 heads, arms, legs .. and that they were split into two and now we search the world for our soulmate from whom we were separated like this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Socrates said that people wish for things that they don’t possess, which he very clearly explains and it makes sense. But then he transfers that principle onto love without any explanation and claims that, therefore, love things that they don’t have. I didn’t see why that should be the case when I was reading the book, but it made more sense when I heard that ancient greek had the same word for love and want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The idea that lovers should make each other the best person they can be also appeared in this book and I like it a lot.</li>
</ul>
