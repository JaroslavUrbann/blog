<p>Its the first book on AI I ever read. Unfortunately, I stopped in about 3/4 of the book, I felt like it was getting repetitive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I liked the authors’ notes on China, it’s a topic I’m very interested in. Here are some thoughts that I haven’t heard before:
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile apps are done differently in western countries - many apps for many different things instead of one big one for everything.</li>
      <li>Western companies routinely fail when investing money and resources into the Chinese market - they don’t adapt to different needs and habits of the Chinese.</li>
      <li>Chinese companies that rip off western brands (in the internet sphere) are not just lazy copycats, they are willing to adapt their product which makes them win out over the original.</li>
      <li>Chinas’ copycats competing against each other gave birth to great Chinese entrepreneurs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And some notes on AIs’ future (and China again):
    <ul>
      <li>The age of implementation arrived and AI research might slow down.</li>
      <li>The amount and quality of data will be a big factor and China has a centralized mobile application (WeChat) that produces enormous amounts of data, and that also reaches much further into the real life of its’ own users more than any other western app.</li>
      <li>I never realized how much of the current AI is just on the internet and not in real life.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some topics from the latter part of the book:
    <ul>
      <li>The potential loss of jobs and existential crisis.
        <ul>
          <li>These topics seemed quite theoretical and were relying on a lot of what-ifs, so decided to skip them. Might revisit them later.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
